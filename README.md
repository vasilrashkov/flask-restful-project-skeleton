# flask-restful-project-skeleton

This repository is just a skeleton for a flask restful application following the tutorial from here (https://medium.freecodecamp.org/structuring-a-flask-restplus-web-service-for-production-builds-c2ec676de563)

In the guide you will see adding of PyJWT, this is missing here and also the security encoding is missing.
